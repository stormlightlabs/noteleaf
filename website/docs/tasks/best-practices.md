# Task Tips and Best Practices

**Start with simple workflows**: Don't over-organize initially. Use basic priorities and projects before adding contexts, tags, and dependencies.

**Review regularly**: Use `task list` daily to check pending work. Weekly reviews help catch stale tasks.

**Use contexts for GTD**: If following Getting Things Done, contexts help filter tasks by what you can do right now.

**Project-based work**: For complex initiatives, use projects to group tasks and dependencies to order work.

**Time tracking for accountability**: Even rough time tracking reveals where hours go and helps with estimates.

**Recurrence for habits**: Use recurring tasks for daily/weekly habits, but keep the list short to avoid clutter.

**Tags for cross-cutting concerns**: Use tags for themes that span projects: `urgent`, `blocked`, `waiting-on-feedback`, `quick-win`.

**JSON output for scripts**: Use `--json` flag with scripting to build custom reports and integrations.

For CLI command reference, run `noteleaf task --help` or explore the inline help on each subcommand.
