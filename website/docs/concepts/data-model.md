# Unified Data Model

## Philosophy

Noteleaf treats all personal information as interconnected. Tasks, notes, articles, books, movies, and TV shows exist in a single database where relationships between items are first-class citizens:

- Link notes to tasks to document your work
- Tag books and articles with the same taxonomy as your tasks
- Track reading lists alongside project work
- Connect media items to research notes

This unified approach mirrors how knowledge work actually happens—projects involve research, reading generates ideas, and ideas spawn tasks.
