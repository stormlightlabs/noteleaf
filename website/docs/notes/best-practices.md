# Note Tips and Best Practices

**Write in plain language**: Notes are for your future self. Avoid jargon you might forget.

**Tag consistently**: Establish a tagging taxonomy early and stick to it. Review tags periodically with `noteleaf note tags`.

**Link liberally**: Reference related notes, tasks, and articles. Future features will leverage these connections.

**Short, focused notes**: Better to have many small notes than few giant ones. Easier to link and reuse.

**Regular review**: Schedule time to review notes, add tags, create links, and archive outdated content.

**Edit immediately**: If you notice incomplete or unclear notes, edit them now. Stale notes lose value.

**Use your editor**: Configure your favorite editor with markdown plugins for better syntax highlighting and live preview.

**Backup regularly**: While notes are files, backup both the notes directory and the database to preserve metadata.

**Experiment with formats**: Try different note structures (journal, zettelkasten, topic-based) to find what works for you.

For CLI command reference, run `noteleaf note --help` or open the contextual help inside the TUI.
